ðŸ§  Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning (ResNet50 & DenseNet121)
This project explores the use of deep learning and transfer learning for the early detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Two pretrained convolutional neural networks â€” ResNet50 and DenseNet121 â€” were fine-tuned on a pediatric chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Key Highlights:

Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras in Google Colab

DenseNet121 showed better generalization and class-level balance

ResNet50 achieved higher accuracy but failed to detect 'Normal' cases

Includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and training visualizations

Suitable for deployment in resource-constrained medical environments

Dataset: Kaggle - Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)
